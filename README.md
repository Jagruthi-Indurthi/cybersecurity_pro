# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Threat Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project is developed as part of the **Blackbucks Short-Term Internship**. It focuses on detecting potential cybersecurity threats using machine learning models and big data tools. The system analyzes logs from system, user behavior, and network data to identify anomalies.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Traditional security systems often fail to detect sophisticated or insider threats. This project addresses that gap by using ML-based anomaly detection on large-scale system logs.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- Anaconda
- GitHub

## 🧩 Project Modules
1. **Round 1** - Exploratory Data Analysis
2. **Round 2** - Feature Engineering & Preprocessing
3. **Round 3** - Model Training & Threat Detection

## 🔁 Workflow
1. Load system log data
2. Preprocess and clean dataset
3. Extract useful features
4. Train ML models to detect anomalies
5. Evaluate and visualize threats

## 📂 Files in This Repo
- `CyberDetection_Round1.ipynb`: Data analysis
- `CyberDetection_Round2.ipynb`: Feature Engineering
- `CyberDetection_Round3.ipynb`: Threat Detection ML Model
- `system_logs.xlsx`: Input log file

## 📌 Expected Output
The ML model flags suspicious users or actions based on anomaly scores. Results are visualized for easier understanding by security teams.
