# Cybersecurity Threat Detection Using Machine Learning

This project detects cybersecurity threats by analyzing system logs using Big Data and Machine Learning tools.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Hadoop Ecosystem (HDFS, Hive, Kafka)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Dataset
- `system_logs.xlsx` — contains sample log data (timestamp, user, IP address, action, status)

## 📊 What it Does
- Parses log data
- Detects anomalies like failed logins or denied access
- Classifies threats using a simple rule-based system
- Visualizes threat patterns using charts

## 📌 Output
- A labeled dataset with `is_threat` column
- Bar charts and time-based plots for threat analysis

## 📝 Project Report
The full notebook (`CyberDetection_Round2.ipynb`) includes code, logic, and output visualizations.
