# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Threat Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project is part of the Blackbucks Short-Term Internship. It focuses on detecting cybersecurity threats using machine learning and big data tools. Logs from systems, user behavior, and network traffic are analyzed to identify anomalies.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Traditional security systems fail to detect complex or insider threats. This project applies ML-based anomaly detection on system logs to bridge that gap.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- Anaconda
- GitHub

## 🧩 Project Modules
- **Round 1**: Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Round 2**: Feature Engineering & Preprocessing
- **Round 3**: ML Model Training & Threat Detection

## 🔁 Workflow
1. Load system log data
2. Clean and preprocess data
3. Extract relevant features
4. Train ML models to detect anomalies
5. Visualize threats for easy understanding

## 📂 Files in This Repo
- `CyberDetection_Round1.ipynb`: EDA
- `CyberDetection_Round2.ipynb`: Feature Engineering
- `CyberDetection_Round3.ipynb`: ML Model & Detection
- `system_logs.xlsx`: Input log data

## ✅ Expected Output
The model flags suspicious activities based on anomaly scores and visualizes the threats for review.
